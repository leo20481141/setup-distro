# My Setup To Distrohope Easily

This is my setup to distrohope easily, it's just public to do the minimal setup possible to use the script, but if you want to modify or use it for your purposes, you're free to do so.

A great idea for example would be to use this as a starting point, that way you would't need to write the whole thing for yourself, just use other people's code and modify it as you wish.
